# SavUTube is a simple, light weight graphical Ubuntu front end interface
# for “ytdl-org / youtube-dl”, using zenity, and written in bash.  It has
# a very small footprint and requires only three files, (the script itself
# 5.0kb, its Icon 3.6kb, and the menu.desktop file, 280b) so it can be run
# on small systems with limited resources.  The optional command-line para-
# meters can be used to set the default download directory, file name, and
# youtube-dl options.  This allows it to be easily added and launched from
# the menu using the included desktop file.
